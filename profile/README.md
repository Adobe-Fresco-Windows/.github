## What is Adobe Fresco?

**Adobe Fresco** is a professional-grade digital drawing and painting application designed specifically for artists, illustrators, and designers. It brings together the world’s largest collection of vector and raster brushes, along with revolutionary **live brushes** that mimic the behavior of real watercolor and oil paints. Whether you’re sketching on the go or creating detailed artwork, Adobe Fresco provides a natural and intuitive experience that feels like working with traditional media.

With seamless integration into the **Adobe Creative Cloud** ecosystem, Fresco allows artists to start a project on their iPad and continue it on their Windows desktop without losing quality or detail. The app is optimized for touch and stylus input, making it a favorite among users of **Microsoft Surface**, **Wacom**, and other pen-enabled devices.

Adobe Fresco is ideal for both beginners and professionals looking to explore digital art with the power of Adobe’s industry-leading tools. From quick sketches to finished paintings, Fresco offers the flexibility and performance needed to bring your creative visions to life.
